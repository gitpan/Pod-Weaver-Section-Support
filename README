NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - add a SUPPORT pod section

VERSION
      This document describes v1.000 of Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - released May 30, 2010 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-Support.

DESCRIPTION
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that lists the common
    support websites and an explanation of how to report bugs. It will do
    this only if it is being built with Dist::Zilla because it needs the
    data from the dzil object.

    If you have Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository enabled in your dist.ini, an
    extra link will be added for the repo.

    This is added ONLY to the main module's POD, because it would be a waste
    of space to add it to all modules in the dist.

    For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SUPPORT"
    section in this POD :)

SUPPORT
    You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
