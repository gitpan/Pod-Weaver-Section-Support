NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - add a SUPPORT pod section

VERSION
      This document describes v1.001 of Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - released December 08, 2010 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-Support.

DESCRIPTION
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that lists the common
    support websites and an explanation of how to report bugs. It will do
    this only if it is being built with Dist::Zilla because it needs the
    data from the dzil object.

    If you have Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository enabled in your dist.ini, be
    sure to check the repository_link attribute!

    This is added ONLY to the main module's POD, because it would be a waste
    of space to add it to all modules in the dist.

    For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SUPPORT"
    section in this POD :)

ATTRIBUTES
  all_modules
    Enable this if you want to add the SUPPORT section to all the modules in
    a dist, not only the main one.

    The default is false.

  bugs
    Specify the bugtracker you want to use. You can use the CPAN RT tracker
    or your own, specified in the metadata.

    Valid options are: "rt", "metadata", or "none"

    If you pick the "rt" option, this module will generate a predefined
    block of text explaining how to use the RT system.

    If you pick the "metadata" option, this module will check the
    Dist::Zilla metadata for the bugtracker to display.

    The default is "rt".

  perldoc
    Specify if you want the paragraph explaining about perldoc to be
    displayed or not.

    The default is true.

  websites
    Specify what website links you want to see. This is an array, and you
    can pick any combination. You can also specify it as a comma-delimited
    string. The ordering of the options are important, as they are reflected
    in the final POD.

    Valid options are: "none", "search", "rt", "anno", "ratings", "forum",
    "kwalitee", "testers", "testmatrix" and "all".

    The default is "all".

            # Where the links go to:
            search          - http://search.cpan.org/dist/$dist
            rt              - http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=$dist
            anno            - http://annocpan.org/dist/$dist
            ratings         - http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/$dist
            forum           - http://cpanforum.com/dist/$dist
            kwalitee        - http://cpants.perl.org/dist/overview/$dist
            testers         - http://cpantesters.org/distro/$first_char/$dist.html
            testmatrix      - http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=$dist

            # in weaver.ini
            [Support]
            websites = search
            websites = forum
            websites = testers , testmatrix

    P.S. If you know other websites that I should include here, please let
    me know!

  irc
    Specify an IRC server/channel/nick for online support. You can specify
    as many networks/channels as you want. The ordering of the options are
    important, as they are reflected in the final POD.

    You specify a network, then a list of channels/nicks to ask for support.

    The default is none.

            # in weaver.ini
            [Support]
            irc = irc.home.org, #support, supportbot
            irc = irc.acme.com, #acmecorp, #acmehelp, #acmenewbies

  irc_content
    Specify the content to be displayed before the irc network/channel list.

    The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

  repository_link
    Specify which url to use when composing the external link. The value
    corresponds to the repository meta resources (for dzil v3 with CPAN Meta
    v2).

    Valid options are: "url", "web", "both", or "none".

    "both" will include links to both the "url" and "web" in separate POD
    paragraphs.

    "none" will skip the repository item entirely.

    The default is "both".

    An error will be thrown if a specified link is not found because if you
    said that you wanted it you probably expect it to be there.

  repository_content
    Text displayed before the link to the source code repository.

    The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

SUPPORT
    You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
